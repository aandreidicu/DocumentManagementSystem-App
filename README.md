# DocumentManagementSystem - AND DMS
An application (server-client) developed using CLI/C++ for easier document management. - DICU Andrei-Stefan , DUMITRASCU Andreea

AND Messenger is a SERVER-CLIENT type application designed for communication and sending of custom user-defined document flows, such as reports or requests. It is intended for use by members of the Air Traffic Management (ATM) community, including students, professors, and military personnel, based on the transmission of serialized packets.

Behind the application, there is a server that manages messages, documents, and user accounts using multiple databases, such as Accounts, Messages, Flows, etc. Through the server, a message sent by a user reaches the selected recipients. The server processes, stores, and then forwards each message to the intended recipients.
